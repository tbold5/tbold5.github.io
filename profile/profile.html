    <p>My name is Tuguldur Trae Bold. I am an aspiring developer who is doing CST program at <a id='bcit'href="https://www.bcit.ca>">BCIT</a>. I am comfortable using HTML, CSS and Javascript, hence I spend a month at Lighthouse Labs prior attending school at BCIT. I like to cook and workout during my free time and I try to make a good habit of reading book during my spare time. I am really excited for my new journey in CST program, as I am sure it will be full of surprises and assignments.</p>
